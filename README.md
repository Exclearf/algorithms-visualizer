# Basic React Application to visualize various sorting algorithms. [^1]
W.I.P.
##General description
Sorting algorithms available:
* Bubble sort;
* Insertion sort;
* Merge sort;
* Quick sort (W.I.P.);
Many different features are yet to come! 
Psst..😅 Rumor has it that there are going to be:
- Visual and hardware speed of execution;
- Custom delay value;
- Dynamically generated graphs with the speed of execution
- Side-by-side algorithms comparison in real time
And much more... 

## How to install
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm start` in your preferred IDE's terminal.
3. Wait for webpage to open in your default browser.

## How to use
1. Choose an algorithm from avaliable options.
2. Select an amount of items in your set.
3. Press button SORT and watch magic happen! 🪄
