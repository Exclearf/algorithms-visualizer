# TypeScript App with React to visualize various sorting algorithms. W.I.P. [^1]

---

## Description
Sorting algorithms available:
* Bubble sort;
* Insertion sort;
* Merge sort;
* Quick sort;
* Selection sort;
* Counting sort;
  
Many different features are yet to come! 
Psst..😅 Rumor has it that there are going to be:
- Bogo sort;
- Radix sort;
- Heap sort;
- Visual and hardware speed of execution;
- Custom delay value;
- Dynamically generated graphs with the speed of execution;
- Side-by-side algorithms comparison in real time;
And much more to come...
